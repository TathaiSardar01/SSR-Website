<section id="Death">
    <h1>Death</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>

    <p>Late actor SSR passed out on 14th June 2020. He died under various mysterious circumstances. Police declared it as Suicide without any investigation. But the suicide theory was not acceptable because the things that had came in front of public was clearly depicting it as a cool blooded murder. Public were not accepting the theories put in front by police and that's why public demanded CBI inquiry in the case. After hearing about the public demand, The Supreme Court held that the FIR registered in Bihar's Patna was legitimate and ordered the CBI to investigate the case. It also said that the Bihar government was competent to recommend transferring the case to the CBI. It's been more than 1 and half years that the case is with CBI, till now we have not got any update from CBI.

    <p>Sushant was actually murdered because the things that came in front of public is clearly telling that it is a cool blooded murder. The most striking thing that have hurt public is this that, if tomorrow someone from our own family will go to Bollywood then the same thing will happen. This is the main reason that people protested a lot. If today we will not stand beside him then tomorrow we will be in place of him. The matter can be normal for us but not for that 74 years old father who lost his son, not for the sisters who will not be able see their brother once again, not for those fans who will never be able to get reply from him again. 
        Now answer me one thing, what will happen if tomorrow the same thing will happen with someone from your family? Will you feel good? The answer is no! You can also come and join us if you listen to your heart and raise your voice against injustice.
